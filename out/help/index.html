				<p>QuickIRC is designed to be simple to use without a lot of noisy bells and whistles. If you just want to connect, this IRC client is for you!</p>
				<p>But maybe you are looking for something feature-rich and complicated. In that case, <a href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a> and <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a> are both very good alternatives. QuickIRC's strength is in its simplicity.</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<section>
				<p>When QuickIRC first opens, you'll see the connection tab. Fill in the host and nickname. The username will automatically fill in. Hit Connect!</p>
				<div style="text-align: center"><img src="connection.png"></div>
				<p>Once the connection comes up, type in <span class="code">/join #chat</span> (replacing <span class="code">#chat</span> with the channel you want to join). Hit Enter, and the channel chatroom will appear!</p>
